- substring_poss(string, k) : returns the number of possible substrings of length k in the input string
- complexity(string, k) : calculates the linguistic complexity of the input string for a given substring length k, which is defined as the ratio of the number of distinct substrings of length k to the total number of possible substrings of length k.

## Usage
- Simply call the functions give a string example and a value of k. Call the function and print its result.
